The children's clinical team wanted to figure out which children were least at risk of community removal (defined as crisis residential rehab (CRR), residential treatment facilities (RTF), host home (a foster care therapeutic placement), acute inpatient(AIP), or being removed from the home by DHS).

This project uses random forests to determine variable importance, which informs logistic regressions for both the time of admission (model 1) and for regular assessment throughout treatment and at the time of discharge (model 2). 

This represents my first project in R, and it happened before I even knew tidyverse was a thing.  So most of the data cleaning and manipulation was in base R.

The final calculator was built in excel.
